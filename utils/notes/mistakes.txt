When solving:
- Read the problem yourself.
- Push implementation problems to the end.
- Write clean code.

Debugging:
- cin the entire input for each test case.
- overflows
- Don't declare two references in the same line
- Print, print, print.
- Computer time is at least 2x more valuable than your own time.

Before Submission
- When precomputing arrays, use more than you need to.
- Check if there are large samples
- Minimal Testcase
