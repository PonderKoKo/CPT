When the problem talks about ranges, rephrase in terms of prefix sums (/xors etc.); Not just to optimize, but to understand and solve.

Venice: Easily Support „Update all“ operation by just storing the water level, subtracting it on insertion, and adding on deletion.

In 2D DP, where next layer depends on ranges in previous layer, optimize with prefix sum.

In bit problems, split upper/lower bits or consider all bits separately.

If you should count all tuples (a, ..., c) that fulfill a property, and just fixing as many as you can within time constraints and counting the remaining ones doesn't work, come up with another property of the tuple and fix that (count all tuples simultaneously that fulfill that property)
